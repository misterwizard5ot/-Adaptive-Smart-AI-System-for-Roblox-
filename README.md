🔥 Adaptive Smart AI System for Roblox 🤖🎮

- This is not just an NPC bot.
- It's a modular, adaptive AI system of the new level, created for serious Roblox projects. 💡

> 🚀 What can this AI do:

 >  - 🧠 Advanced state machine (Idle / Patrol / Chase / Attack / Flee) 🎯
 >  - 👀 Realistic field of view (FOV + Raycast check) 🔍
 >  - 👂 "Hearing" system — reacts to sounds and events 📢
 >  - 🗺️ Smart pathfinding with dynamic route recalculation 🗺️
 >  - ⚔️ Tactical behavior (chasing, obstacle avoidance, distance maintenance) 🏆
 >  - 🔁 Flexible modular architecture 🧩
 >  - 🧩 Easy integration with any NPC 🤖
 >  - ⚡ Optimized for servers (minimal load) ⚡

💎 Why this is not a regular bot?

 >  - NPCs really "think", not just run scripts 💭
 >  - Behavior scales to RPG, PvE, survival, horror and shooters 🎮
 >  - You can add abilities, new sensors and states 🧰
 >  - Supports multiple NPCs simultaneously 👥

🛠️ Architecture:

 > - AI built on the principle:
 >  - State Machine + Behavior Logic 🔄
 >  - Modular Sensors (Vision, Hearing) 🔍👂
 >  - Ability System 💪
 >  - Extensible API 🛠️

```lua
-- Подключение AI к NPC
local AI = require(game.ServerScriptService.AI)

local npc = workspace.NPC -- ваш NPC

AI.new(npc)
    :AddSense("Vision")
    :AddSense("Hearing")
    :AddState("Patrol")
    :AddState("Chase")
    :AddState("Attack")
    :Start

🎯 For whom is this?

> - PvE game developers 🎮
> - RPG creators 📚
> - Horror project makers 🕯️
> - Arena / Survival modes ⚔️
> - Any projects where you need smart NPCs 🤖

> ⚡ In conclusion:
> - This isn't "a script for chasing players".
> - It's a full-fledged AI system that can be expanded and built around it. 💡
 
> - 🔥 Smart NPC = More realistic games + More fun! 🎮✨

> - 📌 Note: Do not use this script in games with cheats or mods that violate Roblox rules. This is fully legal and safe code for your projects. ✅
